# Documenting Others

React Showroom is not just meant for documenting components only, you can use it to create general documentations using markdown as well. For instance, the site that you're looking right now is created with React Showroom.

## Adding Documentation Page

To add a page from markdown, you need to add a [content item](/api/configuration#content-item) in the [`items` configuration](/api/configuration#items).
